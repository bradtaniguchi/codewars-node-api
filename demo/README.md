# Demo

This folder holds a "fake" project that leverages some aspects of the codewars-node-api library.
This primarily exists to show some examples, and act as a sandbox.

Currently this project is "bare" in that its just the example. This will be changed later.

Also this project could be used to run a form of "smoke-test", but this can be added later
